Sometime, even if it's not that easy, trying hard to resolve something you are not sure about, at the end you can be 
proud about what you've done and god it's good to feel proud about something you achieved.

## The context
With one of my colleague, we were working on a solution that would ensure a proper graceful shutdown for a `NodeJS` application.

**The problem :**
- Asynchronous services to process thousands of data that gives business insight for our clients (message loss tolerance is 0)
- A parent process forking a child process to instantiate a redis consumer queue
- A queue consumer instance which is not available from the parent process
- A `SIGTERM` sent on a node child process will instantly kill the child
  - Any consumer running at this time would be instantly killed resulting in:
    - queue consumed messages loss
    - missing to be processed data for our client
- A local environment not ready to test this kind of scenario
- The feedback loop was around 20 to 35 minutes (too long!) with at least all these steps:
  - commit / push
  - CI running:
    - execute test (4-5 minutes)
    - dockerize (3 minutes)
    - publish docker image (3 minutes)
    - deploy docker container (2 minutes)
    - create a new test instance (2 minutes)
    - clean data (2 minutes)
    - launch test (4-15 minutes)
    - observe result (1 minute)

Below is an example of our activity:

[ ![](/assets/images/2022-09-29_1.png) ](/assets/images/2022-09-29_1.png)

As you can see there is a pattern with a long time interval between commit/push and test session (let's say around 6 to 8 tests a day).

## Entering the solution space
**Our work in progress :**

Understand the current behaviour which can be resumed to:

```mermaid!
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'darkMode': 'true'}}}%%
    sequenceDiagram
        Parent Process-->>Agent: instantiate a new agent
        Agent->>Agent: check availability
        Agent-->>Child Process: fork a child
        Child Process-->>Queue Consumer: instantiate a new consumer
        Agent-->>Redis queue: register lock
        Queue Consumer->>Queue Consumer: poll
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: pop messages in queue
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: unregister lock
        Agent->>Agent: check availability
        Agent-->>Child Process: fork a child
        Child Process-->>Queue Consumer: instantiate a new consumer
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: pop messages in queue
        Parent Process->>Agent: send SIGTERM
        Agent-->>Parent Process: exit(0)
```

What we intend to do, listen to a `SIGTERM` signal from the main node process, and properly shutdown the service by propagating the information
to the forked child. Which can be resumed to:

```mermaid!
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'darkMode': 'true'}}}%%
    sequenceDiagram
        Parent Process-->>Agent: instantiate a new agent
        Agent->>Agent: check availability
        Agent-->>Child Process: fork a child
        Child Process-->>Queue Consumer: instantiate a new consumer
        Agent-->>Redis queue: register lock
        Queue Consumer->>Queue Consumer: poll
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: pop messages in queue
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: unregister lock
        Agent->>Agent: check availability
        Agent-->>Child Process: fork a child
        Child Process-->>Queue Consumer: instantiate a new consumer
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: pop messages in queue
        Parent Process->>Agent: send SIGTERM
        Agent->>Agent: stop checking availability
        Child Process->>Queue Consumer: stop polling
        Queue Consumer-->>Redis queue: unregister lock
        Child Process-->>Parent Process: exit(0)
```

Still, we are slowed down by the all process and feedback loop. Let's take a step back for a moment and see if we don't 
have a solution to drop our feedback loop.

### How to drop feedback loop
- By removing the actions that take time
- By decreasing the number of actions

In our context it was obvious we should target our local development environment instead of going on a staging environment.

... we don't have a maintained local environment ðŸ˜±, no problem, let's experiment and identify what is needed to have a local environment.

```mermaid!
%%{init: {'theme': 'base',  'themeVariables': { 'darkMode': 'true'}, 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'local-env'}}}%%
    gitGraph
        commit id: "run docker"
        commit id: "docker-compose configure env variable"
        commit id: "docker-compose configure redis"
        commit id: "docker-compose expose network"
        commit id: "docker-compose volumes to persist sqlite data"
        commit id: "implement sqlite repository"
```
